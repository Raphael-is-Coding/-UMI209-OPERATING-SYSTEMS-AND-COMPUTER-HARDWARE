📁 Repository Structure
1. Homework File
homework-file.pdf- Contains the complete project description, questions, explanations, code implementations, and test results.

2. Bitmap & Linked-List Allocation
This section contains C implementations for disk block allocation methods:

AI-Generated Code:

ai_generated_bitmap.c - Bitmap allocation method (AI-generated version)

ai_generated_linkedlist.c - Linked-list allocation method (AI-generated version)

My Modified Code:

my_bitmap.c - Bitmap allocation method with improved readability and detailed comments

my_linkedlist.c - Linked-list allocation method with enhanced structure and documentation

How to run:
You can execute these C files using any online C compiler (like OnlineGDB, Replit, etc.) or a local C compiler. Each file is fully self-contained and can be compiled independently.

3. Best/Worst/Next-Fit Algorithms
This folder contains Python implementations of three classic memory allocation algorithms:

In the codes there is a ;

Interactive Menu System - Easy-to-use command-line interface

Three Comprehensive Experiments:

Allocation Trace - Fixed sequence allocation/free operations

Fragmentation Test - Random allocations followed by large allocation attempt

Speed Test - Performance comparison of all three algorithms

Detailed Analysis - Each experiment includes explanations and insights

How to run:
Execute the Python file using any Python interpreter (Python 3.6+ recommended). The program will display a menu where you can select which experiment to run or run all experiments sequentially.
